# Script for testing of generalized PSB: (SU)pPSB, (SU)gPSB, SGOMS...

This repository content the script used for the testing of variations of generalized PSB. The different update formulas can be tested with local developed function, with a MatLab library of optimization problems or the CUTEst library. 


# Generalities

## Technical limitations

The code has been developed to be run on HPC cluser computing of Ghent University. One of the main limitation is that only compiled MatLab code can be executed. For the use of CUTEst, it means that the selection of the problems has to be done at the moment of the compilation.
